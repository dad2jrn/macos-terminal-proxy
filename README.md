# macos-terminal-proxy

Allows the MacOS terminal to use the keychain to authenticate to a given proxy.  Ideally this owuld be used within a corporate setting, however; this could easily be adapted to use with a personal home proxy setup.

By using the keychain, you do not have to worry about updating your password within your terminal profile every 60-90 days.
